This is the first project given out by The Odin Project (TOP) for Javascript.
The project is to create a rock, paper, scissors game. 
The game will be played between a human user and the computer.
The computer will randomly choose one of the three choices while the user will be prompted to pick one. At the end of the game the score will be shown to the user.
